                  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
              </b>
              <p>
                  To implement <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep</code>, we utilize de Casteljau's algorithm which a recursive method that uses linear interpolations to define a Bezier curve. Essentially, if we are given n points and interpolate a point in between each pair, resulting up with n - 1 points, repeat until we end up with only one point which will lie on the Bezier curve at a given parameter t which will define the curve ranging from 0 to 1.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The function <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep</code> in my project, we check if there is only one point first; if so, that means we are finished. Otherwise, the function evaluates one step of the de Casteljau's algorithm at a time by checking how many points there currently are or from the previous step. It calculates the lerped points and returns a vector containing the newly interpolated points.

              <p>
                  To extend de Casteljau's algorithm to Bezier surfaces, we can imagine an 4 x 4 array of control points where there are 4 rows of Bezier curves defined as u and along the rows are another set of points that are moving along the Bezier curves in u can be defined as v. We use the same evaluation formula from <code>BezierCurve::evaluationStep</code> for <code>BezierPatch::evaluationStep</code> which <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D</code> will define the single point along the Bezier curve. We recursively apply the 1D de Casteljau's algorithm to u and repeat in the v direction to eventually obtain the surface points, creating a Bezier surface.

              <b>
                  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
              </b>
              <p>
                  To implement the <code>Vertex::normal</code> function, we need to compute the area-weighted normal for each face incident to a vertex. First, we find the position of each vertices in a triangle face by using half-edge structure traversal. Then, we calculate the area of the triangle given these vertices as vectors using the formula below:
                  <div align="center">
                      <p>
                          |(v1 - v0) x (v2 - v0)| * 0.5
                      </p>
                  </div>
                  The above applies cross product to the difference between v1 and v0, and v2 and v0. Find the norm of the cross product and divide it in half. Using the area we just calculated, we weight it with the normal of the face we are evaluating and add this value to a 3D vector that keeps track of all the area-weighted normals. Then, we jump to the next face incident to the vertex using <code>twin()</code> and <code>next()</code>, repeating the process above until we return to our original half-edge. With the 3D vector that contains the sum of all the area-weighted normals, we apply the <code>unit()</code> function and return a normalized sum of all area-weighted normals. This process provides our program with Phong shading which is much smoother than flat shading.

              <p>
                  The <code>HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge()</code> function flips an edge that is shared between two faces. To implement this function, we mark down where all the vertices, edges, half-edges, and faces are located. Then reassign the respective pointers with respect to the direction of the half-edges and flip direction. To visualize the process, we drafted up a simple diagram. This helped avoid any forgotten swaps.

                  Loop division converts a rough polygon mesh into a smoother, high-resolution mesh. To implement loop division, we rely on the two previous parts of splitting and flipping edges. However, before we start actually subdividing, we calculate and store the positions of current vertices and new vertices created by the split. To calculate the position of current vertices, we use:
                  <div align="center">
                      <p>
                          (1 - n * u) * originalPosition + u * sumNeighborPos
                      </p>
                  </div>
                  Where n is the degree of the originalPosition vertex and u is 3/16 if n > 3 otherwise u is 3/8n.
                  Next, we calculate the position of a new vertex as a result of splitting using:
                  <div align="center">
                      <p>
                          3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)
                      </p>
                  </div>
                  Where there is a pair of triangles (A, C, B) and (A, B, D) and edge AB is the edge being split. After computing all the vertex positions as above. We store them in <code>Vector3D Vertex::newPosition</code> for current vertices with new positions and <code>Vector3D Edge::newPosition</code> for vertices that will be inserted in the midpoint of an edge. After storing these positions, we split all the existing edges in the meesh. While doing so, we also flag the new vertices created from it. Next, we flip all the new edges which is marked by our split function with a new vertex and old vertex. Finally, we update vertex positions if they have been flagged as new. There were some issues with determining what was considered a new edge or vertex, but simplified the process by drawing it out.

                  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?

                  Here we apply the recently implemented function on torus.dae. Initially, the mesh is sharp and blocky. But iterating through the levels, we see the mesh becoming smoother and well-blended, eliminating most sharp corners and edges. If we pre-split edges before upsampling, the shape changes as we apply more levels of upsampling.

                  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
              </b>
              <p>
                  Without pre-splitting, we end up with an odd lemon asymmetric shape when we upsample. If we pre-split the diagonals and upsample, then we end up with a symmetrical shape. This fix is a result of giving each corner of the cube an equal number of degrees by splitting the diagonal.
